# What are they trying to do?

![:space 7]

> This bipartite stochastic block model yields a projection-free and statistically principled method for community detection that makes clear assumptions and parameter choices and yields interpretable results.

![:space 10]

Build a model for detecting communities of nodes that...
- doesn't need to project data to unipartite structure
- is statistically 'principled'
- and is interpretable

---

# Why are they trying to do it?

No projections: 
> Using projections creates both practical and principled issues... tend to inflate measures such as assortativity and the clustering coefficient... loss of information... projection of a highly structured bipartite network can appear unstructured

![:space 5]

Statistically Principled and interpretable:
> [Non-SBM attempts] express implicit modeling restrictions and assumptions in their output... Stochastic block models have the advantage of explicitly stating the underlying assumptions, which improves the interpretability of the results.

# The "old" ways

- Project bipartite network into a unipartite one and cluster on that
- Cluster on the bipartite network using matrix decomposition methods
- Use complex and black-box optimization methods


---


# The SBM

- Models the community structure of nodes by collapsing them into blocks
- Defines a probability distribution over all possible community forms
  - Therefor is a 'generative' model
